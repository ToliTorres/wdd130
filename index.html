        <p>My name is Linda Torres, I'm 36 years old, from Mexico City, and I enjoy scuba diving, traveling, and
            watching thrillers
            and movies.
            I consider myself a very analytical person, which is why I enjoy developing and analyzing data and
            programming, since
            there are many ways to achieve a result, but by analyzing it, I can achieve the most optimal performance.
            I have three pets: two dogs and a cat, all of whom are named after Pok√©mon or Star Wars characters.
            I love traveling and love the fact that in my country, I can find all the landscapes and climates I desire
            without
            having to travel to another country to enjoy that great experience. I also love the food from the different
            states of
            Mexico. Mexican cuisine is part of its cultural heritage, so I've also traveled to experience the typical
            dishes of each region.
            In conclusion, I love my country; it's blessed in many ways, and I also love this career because I can work
            from
            anywhere in the world without having to take vacations, or even live anywhere without affecting my job
            prospects.

        <p>Mexico City, the capital of Mexico, is one of the largest and most vibrant cities in the world. It is a
            cultural and economic hub, blending rich history from its Aztec and colonial past with modern architecture,
