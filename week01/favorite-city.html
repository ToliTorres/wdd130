    <h1>My favorite city is Holbox</h1>
    <p>Holbox is a island located in the Mexican state Quintana Roo, just off the Yucatan Peninsula Coast.</p>
    <p>Is the perfect place to spend a few days soaking up the turquoise waters, pristine beaches, delectable tacos and
        bohemian island life.</p>
